            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              D&L Furnitures was born from a simple yet powerful dream: to create furniture that not only beautifies homes but also tells a story of craftsmanship, dedication, and love for our craft. Our founders, driven by their passion for traditional woodworking, decided to bridge the gap between heritage and modernity.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Starting from a small workshop with just a handful of artisans, we have grown into a trusted name in the furniture industry. Every piece that leaves our facility is a testament to the countless hours of work, the quality materials we source, and the expertise of our skilled craftspeople. We believe that furniture is not just about filling spaces—it's about creating memories and providing comfort to families.

            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Our journey hasn't been easy, but the challenges have only strengthened our resolve. We've faced countless obstacles, from sourcing sustainable materials to maintaining our commitment to quality during rapid growth. Yet, with each hurdle, we've learned something valuable that has made us better.

            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              What drives us today is the same passion that started it all: the desire to create furniture that transforms spaces and improves lives. We're not just building furniture; we're building relationships with our customers and contributing to their journey of creating beautiful homes and workplaces.
